\BLDTEST\W SDRAM load test by \RJotego\W
  http://patreon.com/topapate

The SDRAM module runs at 48MHz

Only the first 32MB are tested

Load any file, upto 32MB.
The tester will store it in the
SDRAM. Then load it again
and the tester will compare
the SDRAM contents with the
file.

If you load the file
a third time, the process
will start over. Each time
the SDRAM contents are written
the failure flags are set, so
the screen goes red. After
loading the same file a second
time, the screen should go
green.

If the LED is off, the core
is ready to load a new file
onto the SDRAM. If the LED
is on, the core will use
the next load for comparison

A red screen or a
sound mean that a failure
was detected
