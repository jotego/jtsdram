  \BSDRAM\W test by \RJotego\W

The SDRAM module runs at 96MHz

Only the first 32MB are tested

Red, a blinking LED or a
sound mean that a failure
was detected

The screen should cycle from
bright to dim, indicating that
the test is advancing

There is no end.
The longer, the better

Thanks to Sorgelig, Gyurco and
all the SDRAM builders for their
support.
